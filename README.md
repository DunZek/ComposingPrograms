# Composing Programs

## Text
- [Composing Programs](http://www.composingprograms.com/>) is a free online introduction to programming and computer science.
- In the tradition of [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), this text focuses on methods for:
    - abstraction
    - programming paradigms
    - and techniques for managing the complexity of large programs.
- These concepts are illustrated primarily using the [Python 3](http://www.python.org/) programming language.


- In addition to reading the chapters below, you can apply your knowledge to the [programming projects](https://composingprograms.com/projects.html) that accompany the text
- and visualize program execution using the [Online Python Tutor](https://composingprograms.com/tutor.html).


### Chapter 1: Building Abstractions with Functions

### Chapter 2: Building Abstractions with Data

### Chapter 3: Interpreting Computer Programs

### Chapter 4: Data Processing


## Projects
- These programming projects are designed to complement the Composing Programs text, but they are freely available for any educational use.
- Each project comes with a comprehensive set of test cases so that students can check their work.

### Hog
- The [Hog](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~cs61a/fa13/proj/hog/hog.html) project highlights the use of iteration and higher-order functions from Sections 1.1-1.6 of the text.
- Students build a simulator for a dice game called Hog.
- This project is based on a [2021 SIGCSE Nifty Assignment](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2010/neller-pig/) by Todd Neller.

### Twitter Trends
- The [Twitter Trends](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa13/proj/trends/trends.html) project highlights the use of data abstraction, tuples, lists, and maps from sections 2.1-2.3 of the text.
- Students display U.S. maps colored by the positive or negative sentiment of tweets that contain a search term.
- This project was featured as a (2013 SIGSCE Nifty Assignment)[http://nifty.stanford.edu/2013/denero-muralidharan-trends/]

### Ants Vs SomeBees
- The [Ants Vs SomeBees](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa13/proj/ants/ants.html) project highlights the object-oriented programming paradigm from Section 2.4 of the text.
- Students build a clone of the popular tower defense game, Plants Vs Zombies.
- This project was featured as a [2014 SIGCSE Nifty Assignment](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/denero-ants-vs-somebees/).

### Scheme Interpreter
- The [Scheme Interpreter](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa13/proj/scheme/scheme.html) project asks students to implement an interpreter for a function subset of the Scheme programming language from Chapter 3.
- The project includes a [recursive art contest](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa12/projects/scheme_contest_gallery/scheme_contest.html#submission-1-cs-est-61a)
