[Composing Programs](http://www.composingprograms.com/>) is a free online introduction to programming and computer science.

In the tradition of [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), this text uses Python 3 and focuses on methods for:
- Abstraction
- Programming paradigms
- Techniques for managing the complexity of large programs.

Apply your knowledge by doing the [projects](https://composingprograms.com/projects.html):
- *Each section's folder will have a README about each project.*
- Each project comes with a comprehensive set of test cases.
