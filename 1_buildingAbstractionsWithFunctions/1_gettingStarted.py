""" 1.1 Getting Started
    - All computing begins with:
        1. Representing information
        2. Specifying logic to process it
        3. Desigining abstractions that manage the complexity of that logic
"""
# You must learn how computers interpret programs and carry out the computational process

""" 1.1.1 Programming in Python
    - Python will be used to define computational processes because both man and machine can understand it
    - The language is a large open-source project
        - It was started by Guido van Rossum in the late 80s
