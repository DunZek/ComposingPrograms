    "    - Divide the program into manageable subcomponents which must be debugged ASAP before continuing development.\n",
    "2. Isolate errors\n",
    "    - Trace errors to the smallest fragment of code located within the particular modular component attributed by the error printed.\n",
    "3. Check your assumptions\n",
    "    - Unexpected behavior can and will with time, arise from the programmer's false assumptions and insights used to write the code and generate the program.\n",
    "4. Consult others\n",
    "    - Research.\n",
    "    - Ask either man or machine.\n",
    "    - Procure knowledge from external resources and then return to the problem at hand. \n",
