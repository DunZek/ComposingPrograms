# Chapter 1: Building Abstractions with Functions

## 1.1 Getting Started
- Computer science is terribly broad. Few parts of human life is unaffected. Computing, its science, and computers its realization is powerful because of these elegant and powerful fundamental ideas.
    1. Represent information
    2. Specify logic to process it
    3. Design abstractions that manage the complexity of that logic

## 1.2 Elements of Programming


## 1.3 Defining New Functions


## 1.4 Designing Functions


## 1.5 Control


## 1.6 Higher-Order Functions


## 1.7 Recursive Functions


## Hog
- The [Hog](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~cs61a/fa13/proj/hog/hog.html) project highlights the use of iteration and higher-order functions from Sections 1.1-1.6 of the text.
- Students build a simulator for a dice game called Hog.
- This project is based on a [2021 SIGCSE Nifty Assignment](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2010/neller-pig/) by Todd Neller.
